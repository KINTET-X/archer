<p>NUMBER 1: Dunkleosteus</p>
<p><br> In modern popular culture,‭ ‬Dunkleosteus is by far the best known and most often represented of the early placoderm carnivores.‭ ‬However Dunkleosteus actually sat within the Dinichthys genus for a long time as the species Dinichthys terrelli.‭ ‬It was not until the large numbers of Dinichthys remains were re-studied that it was realised that a large number of the Dinichthys fossils actually represented different genera,‭ ‬not species.‭ ‬The result was that many of these remains were split to form new genera including the creation of Dunkleosteus.‭ ‬In a further twist however,‭ ‬the species that was split to form Dunkleosteus,‭ ‬D.‭ ‬terrelli,‭ ‬was actually the remains most often used when reconstructing Dinichthys.‭ 
       Along with the equally giant Titanichthys,‭ ‬Dunkleosteus is one of the largest predatory placoderm fish known in the fossil record.‭ ‬However unlike Titanichthys which seems to have preferred large quantities of smaller prey items,‭ ‬Dunkleosteus was an apex predator capable of taking down pretty much anything it could clasp its jaws around.
       Because only the armoured head of Dunkleosteus is known,‭ ‬it can be problematic to reconstruct the rear portion that was almost certainly unarmoured.‭ ‬This reasoning comes about from the lack of rear fossils for not just Dunkleosteus but all related placoderms that are similar to Dunkleosteus.‭ ‬The only possible insights come from much smaller placoderms like Coccosteus.‭ ‬With a maximum length approaching only forty centimetres,‭ ‬Coccosteus was positively tiny in comparison to Dunkleosteus,‭ ‬but the impressions of the softer hind body can still be seen in fossils attributed to it.‭ ‬Smaller animals in general tend to fossilise better and in more complete states because they can get protected from scavengers and the elements more quickly.
       Aside from armour,‭ ‬the bony plates of Dunkleosteus could have served two further purposes.‭ ‬As a predatory placoderm,‭ ‬Dunkleosteus likely attacked other related placoderms that had the same kind of bony plates for protection.‭ ‬In the absence of a harder organic material,‭ Dunkleosteus would at least need the same material to break through the armour.‭ ‬Shape the material to a sharp bladed edge,‭ ‬and you have a chance of cutting through it.‭ ‬The second reason is that the jaws need enough driving power to cut and break apart armoured prey,‭ ‬and the only way that this could happen is if Dunkleosteus had incredibly powerful jaw muscles.‭ ‬However these muscles would in turn require strong supports and attachments otherwise the jaws could not be brought to bear with their full force.‭ ‬This is likely why Dunkleosteus and other related placoderms like Eastmanosteus retained armoured heads.
       Although Dunkleosteus had a powerful bite it was not the strongest amongst fish,‭ ‬that title goes to the gigantic shark C. megalodon that lived several hundred million years later.‭ ‬Still,‭ ‬with a bite force estimated at almost two metric tons,‭ ‬Dunkleosteus could still use its sharp jaws to shear through any prey item it chose.‭ ‬What prey items were on the menu seem to have been dependent upon the age of the Dunkleosteus in question.‭ ‬Juvenile Dunkleosteus had stiff jaws best suited for soft bodied prey items.‭ ‬As Dunkleosteus grew older,‭ ‬the jaws would become more flexible,‭ ‬perhaps to better protect them from injury and breakage when dealing with larger,‭ ‬more powerful and more heavily armoured prey items.
       The actual hunting and feeding style of Dunkleosteus is also a popular subject of interest.‭ ‬With the heavy plates around the head,‭ ‬Dunkleosteus was probably not a fast swimmer,‭ ‬but still would have had powerful muscles developed from just swimming around with the weight.‭ ‬This meant that Dunkleosteus either preferred slower prey,‭ ‬or used ambush tactics to try and take its prey off guard.‭ ‬Another thing to consider is that the jaws of Dunkleosteus,‭ ‬and probably other similar placoderms,‭ ‬could open exceptionally fast within a fraction of a second.‭ ‬This would create a sudden void inside the mouth of Dunkleosteus,‭ ‬creating a vacuum that sucked the water and the prey that was swimming in it into its mouth.‭ ‬This means that Dunkleosteus did not have to physically catch its prey,‭ ‬just get close enough to open its mouth.
       Larger Dunkleosteus seemed to have preferred other placoderm fish perhaps like Bothriolepis that was very common at the time.‭ ‬Once caught,‭ ‬Dunkleosteus could use its sharp jaws to cut up prey,‭ ‬but it seems that only the softer and more easily digestible flesh was desired.‭ ‬When Dunkleosteus fossils are found,‭ ‬they are often found in association with fish boluses.‭ ‬A bolus is a ball of remains that has been chewed and swallowed,‭ ‬but the remains in connection with Dunkleosteus are of only bones that already seem to have been partially digested.‭ ‬This indicates that Dunkleosteus may have spat out parts that were too hard for it to digest completely,‭ ‬a precedent that is known in numerous other fish.
       Finally,‭ ‬because Dunkleosteus was at the top of its food chain,‭ ‬the only other thing that it would have to worry about being attacked by was another Dunkleosteus.‭ ‬This actually does seem to have happened with some Dunkleosteus plates actually showing damage that seems to have been inflicted by the jaws of another Dunkleosteus.‭ ‬Asides from territorial combat,‭ ‬this may indicate active cannibalism in Dunkleosteus.

<p><br>NUMBER 2: Rhizodus</p>
<p><br>Rhizodus is the type genus of the Rhizodontida,‭ ‬a fairly large group of lobe-finned fishes,‭ ‬many genera of which are known from deposits in Australia.‭ ‬Most remains of Rhizodus however are known from Ireland and Scotland,‭ ‬though some reports suggest that Rhizodus might have also been active in North America as well,‭ ‬something that is plausible given that North‭ ‬America and Europe were not separated by the Atlantic during the Carboniferous.
       Out of all of the rhizodonts,‭ ‬Rhizodus seems to have been the largest of the group.‭ ‬A single jaw of Rhizodus has been measured at just a little under one meter long,‭ ‬indicating that the individual it belonged to would have been six,‭ ‬possibly as much as seven meters long.‭ ‬This means that Rhizodus might have even been just a bit longer than the largest recorded Great White shark (Carcharodon carcharias) which was accurately measured at just a bit over six meters long.‭ ‬The teeth of Rhizodus were also long and fang-like,‭ ‬and as much as twenty-two centimetres long.‭ ‬These teeth and large physical size suggest that Rhizodus were apex predators that hunted other large fish,‭ ‬primitive sharks and probably even temnospondyl amphibians.

<p><br>NUMBER 3: Xiphactinus</p>
<br>The broad range of fossils discovered around the world suggests that the bony fish Xiphactinus had a cosmopolitan distribution.‭ ‬A comparable similar fish with regards to appearance is the modern day Tarpon.‭ ‬Although Tarpon are not related to the ancient Xiphactinus,‭ ‬their streamlined bodies and strongly upturned mouths bear a striking resemblence.
       One important difference between the two fish are the enlarged teeth present in Xiphactinus fossils.‭ ‬If Xiphactinus failed to swallow its prey in one go,‭ ‬the teeth would have dug in preventing its prey from escaping,‭ ‬allowing Xiphactinus to steadily slide its prey into its mouth,‭ ‬one bite at a time.
       The discovery of a two meter Gillicus arcuatus inside the fossil of a Xiphactinus twice its size is proof that it was a formidable predator,‭ ‬although it is thought that the Xiphactinus may have died from internal injury due to the Gillicus struggling inside of it,‭ ‬explaining why the Gillicus was not digested.‭ ‬Xiphactinus was however also preyed upon by other larger predators as evidenced in a fossil of the shark Cretoxyrhina at least one specimen of which has been found with a large Xiphactinus inside of it.‭ ‬Another shark active in the Western Inland Seaway,‭ ‬‬Squalicorax,‭ ‬also exhibits Xiphactinus remains inside of its own. Xiphactinus could attain a length of possibly seven meters in length.

<p><br>NUMBER 4: Helicoprion</p>
<p><br> Helicoprion is one of the stranger 'sharks' in the fossil record,‭ ‬although at the time that Helicoprion swam the oceans there were actually many sharks that did not conform to the‭ '‬standard‭' ‬form that we know today.‭ ‬The majority of the remains of this shark are the teeth which are fossilised in a spiral pattern like the shell of an ammonite,‭ ‬in fact when first discovered these fossils were actually thought to be some kind of exotic ammonite shell.‭ ‬These arrangements of fossil teeth are today referred to as a‭ '‬tooth-whorl‭'‬.‭ 
       How and where the tooth-whorl attached has been a source of puzzlement to palaeoichthyologists ever since it was realised what it was,‭ ‬and while the obvious choice might be to place the tooth-whorl within the mouth,‭ ‬the whorl has on occasion been placed in different parts including the dorsal fin and even the tail.‭ ‬Today the whorl is almost always placed with the lower jaw,‭ though for a long time not everyone agreed with the exact location.‭ ‬If the whorl was mounted on the tip it would significantly increase the drag that Helicoprion experienced as it swam through the water.‭ ‬Not only would it require more effort to swim,‭ ‬the greater water turbulence would have revealed the presence of Helicoprion to its potential prey.‭ ‬This is why many people now consider the whorl to have been further back into the mouth.
       Then in‭ ‬2013‭ ‬a new study by Tapanila,‭ ‬Pruitt,‭ ‬Pradel,‭ ‬Wilga,‭ ‬Ramsay,‭ ‬Schlader and Didier was published,‭ ‬and this was a watershed moment in the study of Helicorpion as this was the first time that something other than the tooth whorl was studied‭; ‬crushed cartilage that once formed the head and jaw.‭ ‬Although incomplete,‭ ‬the cartilage which was on a fossil found in Idaho in‭ ‬1950‭ ‬and officially described in‭ ‬1966,‭ ‬was completely revealed by a CT scan which then enabled the researchers to use computer modelling to form a reconstruction of Helicoprion.‭ ‬This study led to a new depiction of Helicoprion with a tooth whorl within a shorter lower jaw.   How Helicoprion used its whorl has also been another matter of debate with a variety of theories ranging from the whorl being used as a lash against fish,‭ ‬to a rasp that cut its way through the shells of ammonites with a sawing motion.‭ ‬However even a casual look at the fossil tooth whorls reveals that the teeth have a surprising little amount of wear,‭ ‬and since Helicoprion and relative genera are not thought to have had such a fast replacement of teeth modern day sharks,‭ ‬there is now new speculation that Helicoprion were predators of soft bodied organisms such as molluscs,‭ ‬especially cephalopods such as octopuses.
       It may now only be a matter of time before more cartilaginous remains of Helicoprion are discovered, as other creatures with cartilaginous remains from genera such as Cladoselache, Fadenia and Stethacanthus amongst a growing number of many others are being found.
