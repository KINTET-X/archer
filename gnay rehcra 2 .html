<p>NUMBER 1: Dunkleosteus</p>
<p><br> In modern popular culture,‭ ‬Dunkleosteus is by far the best known and most often represented of the early placoderm carnivores.‭ ‬However Dunkleosteus actually sat within the Dinichthys genus for a long time as the species Dinichthys terrelli.‭ ‬It was not until the large numbers of Dinichthys remains were re-studied that it was realised that a large number of the Dinichthys fossils actually represented different genera,‭ ‬not species.‭ ‬The result was that many of these remains were split to form new genera including the creation of Dunkleosteus.‭ ‬In a further twist however,‭ ‬the species that was split to form Dunkleosteus,‭ ‬D.‭ ‬terrelli,‭ ‬was actually the remains most often used when reconstructing Dinichthys.‭ 
       Along with the equally giant Titanichthys,‭ ‬Dunkleosteus is one of the largest predatory placoderm fish known in the fossil record.‭ ‬However unlike Titanichthys which seems to have preferred large quantities of smaller prey items,‭ ‬Dunkleosteus was an apex predator capable of taking down pretty much anything it could clasp its jaws around.
       Because only the armoured head of Dunkleosteus is known,‭ ‬it can be problematic to reconstruct the rear portion that was almost certainly unarmoured.‭ ‬This reasoning comes about from the lack of rear fossils for not just Dunkleosteus but all related placoderms that are similar to Dunkleosteus.‭ ‬The only possible insights come from much smaller placoderms like Coccosteus.‭ ‬With a maximum length approaching only forty centimetres,‭ ‬Coccosteus was positively tiny in comparison to Dunkleosteus,‭ ‬but the impressions of the softer hind body can still be seen in fossils attributed to it.‭ ‬Smaller animals in general tend to fossilise better and in more complete states because they can get protected from scavengers and the elements more quickly.
       Aside from armour,‭ ‬the bony plates of Dunkleosteus could have served two further purposes.‭ ‬As a predatory placoderm,‭ ‬Dunkleosteus likely attacked other related placoderms that had the same kind of bony plates for protection.‭ ‬In the absence of a harder organic material,‭ Dunkleosteus would at least need the same material to break through the armour.‭ ‬Shape the material to a sharp bladed edge,‭ ‬and you have a chance of cutting through it.‭ ‬The second reason is that the jaws need enough driving power to cut and break apart armoured prey,‭ ‬and the only way that this could happen is if Dunkleosteus had incredibly powerful jaw muscles.‭ ‬However these muscles would in turn require strong supports and attachments otherwise the jaws could not be brought to bear with their full force.‭ ‬This is likely why Dunkleosteus and other related placoderms like Eastmanosteus retained armoured heads.
       Although Dunkleosteus had a powerful bite it was not the strongest amongst fish,‭ ‬that title goes to the gigantic shark C. megalodon that lived several hundred million years later.‭ ‬Still,‭ ‬with a bite force estimated at almost two metric tons,‭ ‬Dunkleosteus could still use its sharp jaws to shear through any prey item it chose.‭ ‬What prey items were on the menu seem to have been dependent upon the age of the Dunkleosteus in question.‭ ‬Juvenile Dunkleosteus had stiff jaws best suited for soft bodied prey items.‭ ‬As Dunkleosteus grew older,‭ ‬the jaws would become more flexible,‭ ‬perhaps to better protect them from injury and breakage when dealing with larger,‭ ‬more powerful and more heavily armoured prey items.
       The actual hunting and feeding style of Dunkleosteus is also a popular subject of interest.‭ ‬With the heavy plates around the head,‭ ‬Dunkleosteus was probably not a fast swimmer,‭ ‬but still would have had powerful muscles developed from just swimming around with the weight.‭ ‬This meant that Dunkleosteus either preferred slower prey,‭ ‬or used ambush tactics to try and take its prey off guard.‭ ‬Another thing to consider is that the jaws of Dunkleosteus,‭ ‬and probably other similar placoderms,‭ ‬could open exceptionally fast within a fraction of a second.‭ ‬This would create a sudden void inside the mouth of Dunkleosteus,‭ ‬creating a vacuum that sucked the water and the prey that was swimming in it into its mouth.‭ ‬This means that Dunkleosteus did not have to physically catch its prey,‭ ‬just get close enough to open its mouth.
       Larger Dunkleosteus seemed to have preferred other placoderm fish perhaps like Bothriolepis that was very common at the time.‭ ‬Once caught,‭ ‬Dunkleosteus could use its sharp jaws to cut up prey,‭ ‬but it seems that only the softer and more easily digestible flesh was desired.‭ ‬When Dunkleosteus fossils are found,‭ ‬they are often found in association with fish boluses.‭ ‬A bolus is a ball of remains that has been chewed and swallowed,‭ ‬but the remains in connection with Dunkleosteus are of only bones that already seem to have been partially digested.‭ ‬This indicates that Dunkleosteus may have spat out parts that were too hard for it to digest completely,‭ ‬a precedent that is known in numerous other fish.
       Finally,‭ ‬because Dunkleosteus was at the top of its food chain,‭ ‬the only other thing that it would have to worry about being attacked by was another Dunkleosteus.‭ ‬This actually does seem to have happened with some Dunkleosteus plates actually showing damage that seems to have been inflicted by the jaws of another Dunkleosteus.‭ ‬Asides from territorial combat,‭ ‬this may indicate active cannibalism in Dunkleosteus.

<p><br>NUMBER 2: Rhizodus</p>
<p><br>Rhizodus is the type genus of the Rhizodontida,‭ ‬a fairly large group of lobe-finned fishes,‭ ‬many genera of which are known from deposits in Australia.‭ ‬Most remains of Rhizodus however are known from Ireland and Scotland,‭ ‬though some reports suggest that Rhizodus might have also been active in North America as well,‭ ‬something that is plausible given that North‭ ‬America and Europe were not separated by the Atlantic during the Carboniferous.
       Out of all of the rhizodonts,‭ ‬Rhizodus seems to have been the largest of the group.‭ ‬A single jaw of Rhizodus has been measured at just a little under one meter long,‭ ‬indicating that the individual it belonged to would have been six,‭ ‬possibly as much as seven meters long.‭ ‬This means that Rhizodus might have even been just a bit longer than the largest recorded Great White shark (Carcharodon carcharias) which was accurately measured at just a bit over six meters long.‭ ‬The teeth of Rhizodus were also long and fang-like,‭ ‬and as much as twenty-two centimetres long.‭ ‬These teeth and large physical size suggest that Rhizodus were apex predators that hunted other large fish,‭ ‬primitive sharks and probably even temnospondyl amphibians.
</p>
<p><br>NUMBER 3: Xiphactinus</p>
<br>The broad range of fossils discovered around the world suggests that the bony fish Xiphactinus had a cosmopolitan distribution.‭ ‬A comparable similar fish with regards to appearance is the modern day Tarpon.‭ ‬Although Tarpon are not related to the ancient Xiphactinus,‭ ‬their streamlined bodies and strongly upturned mouths bear a striking resemblence.
       One important difference between the two fish are the enlarged teeth present in Xiphactinus fossils.‭ ‬If Xiphactinus failed to swallow its prey in one go,‭ ‬the teeth would have dug in preventing its prey from escaping,‭ ‬allowing Xiphactinus to steadily slide its prey into its mouth,‭ ‬one bite at a time.
       The discovery of a two meter Gillicus arcuatus inside the fossil of a Xiphactinus twice its size is proof that it was a formidable predator,‭ ‬although it is thought that the Xiphactinus may have died from internal injury due to the Gillicus struggling inside of it,‭ ‬explaining why the Gillicus was not digested.‭ ‬Xiphactinus was however also preyed upon by other larger predators as evidenced in a fossil of the shark Cretoxyrhina at least one specimen of which has been found with a large Xiphactinus inside of it.‭ ‬Another shark active in the Western Inland Seaway,‭ ‬‬Squalicorax,‭ ‬also exhibits Xiphactinus remains inside of its own. Xiphactinus could attain a length of possibly seven meters in length.

<p><br>NUMBER 4: Helicoprion</p>
<p><br> Helicoprion is one of the stranger 'sharks' in the fossil record,‭ ‬although at the time that Helicoprion swam the oceans there were actually many sharks that did not conform to the‭ '‬standard‭' ‬form that we know today.‭ ‬The majority of the remains of this shark are the teeth which are fossilised in a spiral pattern like the shell of an ammonite,‭ ‬in fact when first discovered these fossils were actually thought to be some kind of exotic ammonite shell.‭ ‬These arrangements of fossil teeth are today referred to as a‭ '‬tooth-whorl‭'‬.‭ 
       How and where the tooth-whorl attached has been a source of puzzlement to palaeoichthyologists ever since it was realised what it was,‭ ‬and while the obvious choice might be to place the tooth-whorl within the mouth,‭ ‬the whorl has on occasion been placed in different parts including the dorsal fin and even the tail.‭ ‬Today the whorl is almost always placed with the lower jaw,‭ though for a long time not everyone agreed with the exact location.‭ ‬If the whorl was mounted on the tip it would significantly increase the drag that Helicoprion experienced as it swam through the water.‭ ‬Not only would it require more effort to swim,‭ ‬the greater water turbulence would have revealed the presence of Helicoprion to its potential prey.‭ ‬This is why many people now consider the whorl to have been further back into the mouth.
       Then in‭ ‬2013‭ ‬a new study by Tapanila,‭ ‬Pruitt,‭ ‬Pradel,‭ ‬Wilga,‭ ‬Ramsay,‭ ‬Schlader and Didier was published,‭ ‬and this was a watershed moment in the study of Helicorpion as this was the first time that something other than the tooth whorl was studied‭; ‬crushed cartilage that once formed the head and jaw.‭ ‬Although incomplete,‭ ‬the cartilage which was on a fossil found in Idaho in‭ ‬1950‭ ‬and officially described in‭ ‬1966,‭ ‬was completely revealed by a CT scan which then enabled the researchers to use computer modelling to form a reconstruction of Helicoprion.‭ ‬This study led to a new depiction of Helicoprion with a tooth whorl within a shorter lower jaw.   How Helicoprion used its whorl has also been another matter of debate with a variety of theories ranging from the whorl being used as a lash against fish,‭ ‬to a rasp that cut its way through the shells of ammonites with a sawing motion.‭ ‬However even a casual look at the fossil tooth whorls reveals that the teeth have a surprising little amount of wear,‭ ‬and since Helicoprion and relative genera are not thought to have had such a fast replacement of teeth modern day sharks,‭ ‬there is now new speculation that Helicoprion were predators of soft bodied organisms such as molluscs,‭ ‬especially cephalopods such as octopuses
       It may now only be a matter of time before more cartilaginous remains of Helicoprion are discovered, as other creatures with cartilaginous remains from genera such as Cladoselache, Fadenia and Stethacanthus amongst a growing number of many others are being found.

<p>The teeth are by far the most common remains of C. megalodon with the larger teeth approaching‭ ‬18‭ ‬centimetres in height.‭ ‬It is uncertain for how long people have been collecting C. megalodon teeth,‭ ‬but it was not until‭ ‬1667‭ ‬that science recognised them as shark teeth.‭ ‬Before this time people generally and honestly thought that C. megalodon teeth were actually the tongues of dragons that had been petrified‭ (‬turned to stone‭)‬.‭ ‬The truth about them came about when the Danish naturalist Nicolas Steno correctly identified one of these‭ '‬dragon tongues‭' ‬and mentioned it in his book The Head of a Shark Dissected.
       C. megalodon teeth are usually compared with those of the great white shark because of their superficial similarities of being triangular and serrated.‭ ‬Because of this similarity,‭ ‬particularly with the serrations,‭ ‬it is thought that C. megalodon had the same biting style as the great white shark.‭ ‬This would involve biting down upon its prey and then shaking its head from side to side so that the teeth serrations sawed through the flesh.‭ 
       There have even been what are close to being complete sets of C. megalodon teeth from the same individual found together.‭ ‬These reveal that C. megalodon was like other sharks in that the largest teeth were at the front of the mouth.‭ ‬Also the further towards the front the teeth were,‭ ‬the more evenly triangular they became.‭ ‬The more sideward the teeth went towards the rear of the jaws,‭ ‬the more inwardly curved they became.‭ ‬These teeth would hook into the flesh of the prey making it harder for it to escape while the front teeth did the cutting.
       One of the most common myths most often told about C. megalodon is that it is only known from teeth.‭ ‬In reality the teeth are by far the most common fossils of C. megalodon,‭ ‬but a small and growing number of vertebras have also been recovered.‭ ‬In shark biology in general,‭ ‬the skeleton is always made up of‭ '‬soft‭' ‬cartilage,‭ ‬but the vertebrate are made up of harder calcified cartilage.‭ ‬This means that while the vertebra can and often do decompose,‭ ‬they can survive for longer increasing the chance of them getting fossilised.Ever since the teeth of C. megalodon were realised to be the teeth of sharks most people immediately asked,‭ '‬but how big was the shark‭?'‬.‭ ‬The honest answer is that we don't exactly know for certain because there is no complete specimen that someone can take a tape measure to.‭ ‬So instead palaeontologists and ichthyologists have to work with what they have,‭ ‬in this case the teeth.‭ ‬They have been many studies into estimating the length of a shark based upon analysing teeth,‭ ‬the four most commonly referred to being here.‭ 
       One method once used to gauge the length of C. megalodon was from measuring the height of the tooth enamel.‭ ‬This method was developed by John E.‭ ‬Randall in‭ ‬1973‭ ‬and resulted in an estimate of‭ ‬13‭ ‬meters.‭ ‬However the method is not considered accurate by the wider scientific community as the method was first originated by comparing the teeth of the great white shark,‭ ‬and although these teeth appear similar at a glance,‭ ‬they are actually quite different from the teeth of C. megalodon.‭ ‬Also the amount of enamel on a tooth can vary even amongst teeth of the same species through wear and poor preservation.
       Another method of estimation developed in‭ ‬1996‭ ‬by Michael D.‭ ‬Gottfried,‭ ‬Leonard J.‭ ‬V.‭ ‬Compagno and S.‭ ‬Curtis Bowman works on the basis of establishing a correlation between the slant height of a tooth and the length of the shark.‭ ‬Slant height is not the total height but the length of the tooth tip to the lateral edge,‭ ‬and is the actual cutting length of the tooth.‭ ‬Again this study was based upon the study of great white teeth,‭ ‬and this yielded an estimate of‭ ‬15.9‭ ‬meters.‭ ‬However‭ ‬even if this method is reliable,‭ ‬it can only give estimates from the given teeth,‭ ‬and not necessarily the species.
       In‭ ‬2002‭ ‬Dr.‭ ‬Clifford Jeremiah established another method based upon the width of a tooth root,‭ ‬the bit below the crown that is covered by flesh.‭ ‬This is a simple principle that the width of the tooth crown can be used to figure out the width of the jaw,‭ ‬which in turn can be used to work out the length of the shark.‭ ‬In the simplest terms it works on the basis that there is‭ ‬1‭ ‬centimetre of tooth root for roughly every‭ ‬129‭ ‬centimetres of body length.‭ ‬This resulted in a‭ ‬15.5‭ ‬meter length estimate for a tooth which had around‭ ‬12‭ ‬centimetres of root.
       Also in‭ ‬2002,‭ ‬Dr.‭ ‬Kenshu Shimada developed another more complex method based upon the proportions of the tooth crown.‭ ‬When this method was used upon the tooth that had been used by Gottfried et al.‭ ‬in‭ ‬1996,‭ ‬the estimated length came back as‭ ‬15.1‭ ‬meters.‭ ‬The maximum estimate ever yielded from this method was obtained from a particularly large tooth from Panama which gave a body length of‭ ‬16.8‭ ‬meters.
